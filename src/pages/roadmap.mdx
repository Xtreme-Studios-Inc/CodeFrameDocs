## Why CodeFrame Had to Launch Early

I chose to leave behind financial stability to build XtremeStudios and bring CodeFrame to life. This is more than just a project — it’s a commitment to creating something that matters.

Building alone means making trade-offs. ARM64 support was the hardest to set aside for the initial release, but waiting until every feature was perfect would have meant never finding out if CodeFrame is something people actually want.

Launching early is the only way to test that.  
If it resonates, it grows into the tool I believe it can be.  
If not, I’ll take the lessons forward and refocus my skills where they can create the most impact.

## Whats Missing

**Platform Support**

- ARM64 (Windows) – planned
- Linux – planned
- macOS – planned

**Planned features**

- Package Manager: broader architecture flags, versioning, publish to CodeFrame
- CodeFrame Config: Handle edge cases and have clear minimal config to start a project.
- Commands: `init` (project converter), `document`, `generate` (schematics), `execute` (one-shot C++)
- VSCode Extension: codeframe manager, in-app docs, scaffold/manage schematics, create your own schematics

:::info ⏳ Ongoing Development
Active work is happening on the **CodeFrame Library** right now.  
Expect frequent updates as we refine the API, improve stability, and add planned features.
