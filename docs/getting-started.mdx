Welcome to **CodeFrame**! This guide will walk you through downloading, installing, and creating your first C++ project.

<br />

### Step 1 - Download CodeFrame

<div
  style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "center", gap: 9, margin: "16px 0" }}
>
  <img
    src="/img/logo.svg"
    alt="CodeFrame Logo"
    width="80"
    style={{ height: 65, width: "auto" }}
  />
  <a
    href="https://github.com/Xtreme-Studios-Inc/CodeFrameDocs/releases"
    target="_blank"
    style={{
      display: "inline-flex",
      alignItems: "center",
      padding: "13px 20px",
      lineHeight: 1,
      whiteSpace: "nowrap",
      backgroundColor: "var(--ifm-color-primary)",
      color: "white",
      borderRadius: 8,
      textDecoration: "none",
      fontWeight: "bold",
      fontFamily: "sans-serif",
      boxShadow: "0 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)",
      alignSelf: "center",
      flex: "0 0 auto",
      height: "auto",
      marginLeft: 12,
    }}
  >
    {"Download"}
  </a>
</div>

<br />

### Step 2 — Install CodeFrame

Follow the installation instructions on our custom installer to install codeframe.

:::note

At this time, the CodeFrame installer is **not digitally signed**. While we can assure you that it is safe, contains no viruses, and comes directly from the official CodeFrame source, Windows may display a warning when you run it.  
It is entirely up to you to decide whether to proceed and allow the installation.

<br />

### Step 3 — Create Your First Project

Once installed, open a terminal in your desired workspace folder and run:

```bash
cf new
```

<br />

### Step 4 — Choose a Template

CodeFrame comes with multiple project templates. When prompted, pick the one that best fits your needs:

- Default — Minimal setup to get started quickly.
- CLI — Command-Line interface project template.
- (Coming Soon) Game — Includes rendering and basic graphics setup.
- (Coming Soon) GUI - Event-driven graphical application with a native window.

<br />
### Step 5 — Open Your Project With [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/){" "}

For its excellent integration with CodeFrame we recommend downloading **VSCode**.

To open your new project in VS Code:

```bash
code ./[PROJECT_NAME]
```

<br />
### Step 6 — Build & Run

From your project folder:

```bash
cf build
```

Then run your project

```bash
./build/default/[PROJECT_NAME].exe
```
