# ðŸ“š API Reference

The CodeFrame API documentation is [Coming Soon](../../roadmap).

At this stage, the library is **not production-ready** â€” this release is public to **encourage collaboration, feedback, and exploration** from the community.  
Expect breaking changes, missing features, and evolving design decisions.

ðŸš§ **Planned:** CodeFrame will soon be available as an **installable package** to make testing and contribution even easier.
