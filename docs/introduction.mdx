# What is CodeFrame?

:::tip

Ready to dive in? Head straight to the [**Get Started**](/docs/getting-started) guide.

:::

**CodeFrame** is the next-generation C++ build tool bringing speed, simplicity, and
modern features you expect from tools like Bun or npm, to the lower level.

Our vision is simple but ambitious: **one tool for any coding need** ‚Äî starting with the world‚Äôs most foundational language, C++. We won‚Äôt stop until it works for every developer, in every language.

## Motivation & Philosophy

**CodeFrame** was created to bring simplicity to C++ development, eliminating
the overhead and frustration of complex setup, configuration, and tooling.

The goal is to make starting, building, and scaling projects as frictionless as possible.

## Key Benefits:

- Simplicity: A project that truly values getting out of your way.

- Full Control: Everything ‚Äújust works‚Äù by default, but you still have complete access to all files and resources if you want to dig deeper.

- Minimal Config, Smart Defaults: Start building immediately; tweak only when you need to.

## Looking Ahead

Our long-term vision is to open-source CodeFrame once the project‚Äôs community is strong enough to sustain ongoing development.  
Until then, we‚Äôre focused on making CodeFrame rock-solid, modern, and truly useful for every developer.

Stay tuned. The best is yet to come.

## Invitation to Join:

We‚Äôre building CodeFrame in public. That means your feedback, ideas, and contributions shape where it goes next.

- [**Follow the Roadmap**](../roadmap) to see what‚Äôs coming.
- **Spread the word** if you believe C++ development deserves something better.
- üí¨**Join the community** to share ideas, ask questions, report issues, and help improve the tool.
  - [Start a Discussion](https://github.com/Xtreme-Studios-Inc/CodeFrameDocs/discussions)
  - [Report a Bug](https://github.com/Xtreme-Studios-Inc/CodeFrameDocs/issues)

Together, we can make building in C++ faster, simpler, and a whole lot more enjoyable.
