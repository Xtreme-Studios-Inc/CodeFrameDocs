# What is CodeFrame?

:::tip

Ready to dive in? Head straight to the [**Get Started**](/docs/getting-started) guide.

:::

**CodeFrame** is the next-generation C++ build tool bringing speed, simplicity, and
modern features you expect from tools like Bun or npm, to C++.

Our vision is simple but ambitious: **one tool for any coding need** — starting with the world’s most foundational language, C++. We won’t stop until it works for every developer, in every language.

## Motivation & Philosophy

**CodeFrame** was created to bring simplicity to **C++** development, eliminating
the overhead and frustration of complex setup, configuration, and tooling.

The goal is to make starting, building, and scaling projects as frictionless as possible.

## Key Benefits:

- Simplicity: A project that truly values getting out of your way.

- Full Control: Everything “just works” by default, but you still have complete access to all files and resources if you want to dig deeper.

- Minimal Config, Smart Defaults: Start building immediately; tweak only when you need to.

## Looking Ahead

Our long-term vision is to open-source **CodeFrame** once the project’s community donations can sustainably support ongoing development.  
Until then, we’re focused on making **CodeFrame** rock-solid, modern, and truly useful for every developer.

Stay tuned—the best is yet to come.

## Invitation to Join:

We’re building CodeFrame in public. That means your feedback, ideas, and contributions shape where it goes next.

- **Follow the roadmap** to see what’s coming.
- **Join the community** to share ideas, report issues, and help improve the tool.
- **Spread the word** if you believe C++ development deserves something better.

Together, we can make building in C++ faster, simpler, and a whole lot more enjoyable.
