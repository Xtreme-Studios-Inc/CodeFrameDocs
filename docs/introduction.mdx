# What is CodeFrame?

**CodeFrame** is the next-generation C++ project build tool—bringing the speed, simplicity, and modern features you expect from tools like Bun or npm, but made for C++.

We don’t do everything those tools can (yet), but that’s exactly where we’re headed.

Our vision: One tool for any coding need.
It’s ambitious, but we’re not stopping until it happens.
Any language, one tool starting with the world’s most foundational language: C++.

<br />

:::warning
**CodeFrame** is not yet production-ready. Use with caution—APIs and commands may change as development continues and the tool evolves.

## Motivation & Philosophy

**CodeFrame** was created to bring simplicity to **C++** development, eliminating the overhead and frustration of complex setup, configuration, and tooling.
The goal: make starting, building, and scaling **C++** projects as frictionless as possible.

Although **CodeFrame** isn’t a full drop-in replacement for traditional tools (yet), our mission is ongoing:

- To standardize the process.
- To ensure you can build any **CodeFrame** project with a single command.
- If it doesn’t scale, it’s out—our focus is on solutions that work for any project size.

Progress can be slow, because we sweat every detail—choosing the best possible approach at every step.
Quality and long-term simplicity always win over quick hacks.

## Key Benefits:

- Simplicity: A project that truly values getting out of your way.
- Modern **C++** Focus: Built for today’s **C++** workflows and standards.
- Batteries-Included: Every generated project comes with the **CodeFrame** **C++** library—available instantly as a header-only repo.
- Full Control: Everything “just works” by default, but you still have complete access to all files and resources if you want to dig deeper.
- Minimal Config, Smart Defaults: Start building immediately; tweak only when you need to.

## Quickstart:

How do I create and build a project, in one or two lines.

## Looking Ahead

Our long-term vision is to open-source CodeFrame once the project’s community donations can sustainably support ongoing development. Until then, we’re focused on making CodeFrame rock-solid, modern, and truly useful for every C++ developer.

**In active development:**

- Cleaning up and expanding the CodeFrame API library
- Introducing a new UI project template
- Improving build performance by optimizing the #include hierarchy
- Expanding the `document` command for better codebase docs
- Enhancing schematic management—soon you’ll be able to create, manage, and generate custom project schematics with `cf gen [SCHEMATIC_NAME]`

Stay tuned—the best is yet to come.
